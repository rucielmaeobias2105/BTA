/**
 * The password show/hide toggle, on every screen that has one.
 *
 * The requirement was that it works in four places: the admin login, the
 * customer login, and the password fields on both profile screens. It worked in
 * none of them, and for one reason — see `test_the_selector_matches_the_markup`
 * below, which is the test that matters here. The rest assert that each location
 * is actually wired, because "the helper works" and "this form has a toggle" are
 * different claims and only the second one is what a user experiences.
 *
 * What cannot be asserted without a browser is the click itself. So the
 * JavaScript is checked structurally instead: that it selects the attribute the
 * markup renders, that it flips `type`, and that it drives the icon swap through
 * the class the stylesheet keys off.
