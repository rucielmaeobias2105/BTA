/**
 * One active role per browser.
 *
 * The scenario this exists for: signed in as a CUSTOMER in Tab A, open Tab B and
 * sign in as ADMIN — Tab A must stop behaving like a customer page, rather than
 * sitting there showing a dashboard with working links until it happens to
 * navigate.
 *
 * Two halves, and this file pins both:
 *
 *   - the server, where a login logs the other guard out, so the browser never
 *     holds two active roles at all; and
 *   - the client, where each page states its identity in a `bta-session` meta tag
 *     and `sessionSync` in `resources/js/app.js` reconciles the other tabs.
 *
 * The client half cannot be exercised by PHPUnit — there is no browser here and
 * no `localStorage`. What is asserted below is its contract: the identity a page
 * publishes, where it sends a tab when the browser disagrees, and that the two
 * guards really are exclusive.
 *
 * The guard-exclusivity tests go through the real login forms rather than
 * `actingAs()`. `actingAs` injects a user straight into the guard without
 * touching the session, so the mutual logout under test would never run — the
 * test would pass for the wrong reason, or fail for one.
