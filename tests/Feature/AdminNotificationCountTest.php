/**
 * The admin work-queue count: where it is shown, and what reading does to it.
 *
 * Three separate things are under test here and it is worth keeping them apart,
 * because they are separate decisions:
 *
 *   - the *placement* of the count — on the sidebar rows that own it, and not on
 *     an icon in the top bar, which is a regression guard on a decision that has
 *     already been made twice in this codebase in both directions; and
 *   - what the count *does* when an enquiry is read, which is a behaviour
 *     question about the endpoints and the numbers they return.
 *
 * The second is deliberately only about enquiries. A booking sitting in Pending
 * is work, not a message, and no amount of looking at the count should clear it —
 * see NotificationReadController. There is a test here pinning that, because
 * "mark as read" quietly growing to cover bookings would be the easy way to make
 * a count reach zero and the most damaging thing that could happen to it.
