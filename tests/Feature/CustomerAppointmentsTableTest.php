 *
 *   - the header is a title and a button, nothing else;
 *   - the Appointment Details screen is a dialog on this page, not a page of

 *     reference, payment status — is now carried in that dialog's payload; and
 *   - deletion is available only on a settled booking, in one row or in a
 *     ticked set, through the shared confirmation dialog.
