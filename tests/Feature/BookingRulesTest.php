/**
 * The booking date rules and the toast surface.
 *
 * Two of the date rules are the same rule reached two ways — the date input's
 * `min` and the server's rejection — so both are asserted. A change that only
 * moves one leaves a date bookable in the UI but not in the database, or the
 * reverse.
 *
 * What went with the Calendar & Blocked Dates feature: the blocked-date cases,
 * the admin calendar's chip tests, and the toasts only the calendar's own actions
 * raised. `CalendarRemovalTest` covers the removal itself — that no screen can
 * block a date, and that booking still enforces every rule that is left.
 *
 * The category-colour tests stay. The colour a category resolves to is still a
 * property of the category row and the category screen still uses it, even though
 * no admin grid paints chips with it any more.
