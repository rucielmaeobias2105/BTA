/**
 * The unread count in the browser tab title: "(3) NOTIFICATIONS | Balai ti Arjud",
 * the way Messenger and Facebook do it.
 *
 * Two properties matter and they are tested separately.
 *
 * The first is that the count is *right*. Rendered server-side, so it is correct
 * before the bundle has loaded — that is the window in which a user reads the
 * title to decide whether to switch to a background tab. A guest's tab carries no
 * prefix at all, because "(0) HOME" is noise.
 *
 * The second is that it is *live*, driven by the same poll as the bell badge.
 * Asserted against the JavaScript source rather than in a browser: what has to be
 * true is that one fetched count feeds both the badge and `document.title`, and
 * that there is no second polling mechanism for the title that could drift.
