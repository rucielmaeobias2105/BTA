/**
 * Who may remove an appointment, when, and how.
 *
 * Three rules, and the tests are grouped by them because they can fail
 * independently:
 *
 *   1. only a *settled* booking (Completed or Cancelled) can be archived or
 *      deleted — never one that is Pending, Confirmed or, above all, In Progress;
 *   2. archiving is a filing decision that an admin can take at any moment, and is
 *      independent of the 30-day rule in both directions; and
 *   3. the nightly sweep archives completed bookings past the window on its own,
 *      and only those.
 *
 * Every rule is checked on the *route*, not just the model method. A view that
 * forgets to render the button is a cosmetic bug; a controller that forgets to
 * check is the actual hole, so the assertions here post crafted requests.
