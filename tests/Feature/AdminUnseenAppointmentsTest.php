/**
 * The admin's unread-appointment badge, and the tab title built from it.
 *
 * The badge used to count bookings in Pending, which is a status rather than an
 * acknowledgement. Nothing about *looking* at the Appointments page changed it, so
 * the number stayed on the sidebar and in the tab title for as long as a booking
 * sat undecided — including while the admin was reading the very list it was
 * counting.
 *
 * `admin_seen_at` separates the two ideas, and this file pins the behaviour that
 * comes out of that:
 *
 *   - opening the screen clears the badge and the title prefix, server-side, on the
 *     first render;
 *   - "unseen" is not "Pending" — either can be true without the other;
 *   - a booking that arrives afterwards brings the badge back, counting only itself;
 *   - the sidebar badge and the tab title are the same number, read from one place;
 *   - the poll agrees with the server-rendered halves.
