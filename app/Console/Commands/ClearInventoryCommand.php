 * Empties the stockroom without touching anything else.

 * The inventory seeder is gone, but a database that was seeded before it was
 * removed still holds those demo rows, and the low-stock badge on the sidebar
 * counts them. This is the one-off cleanup for that: it removes the items and
 * the service↔item links, and deliberately nothing else — services, customers,
 * appointments and every other table are left exactly as they are.
 *
 * Guarded behind --force, because deleting stock records is not something to
