     * silently be missing from it and from the chips. Creating the row on save —
     * taking the next unused palette colour — is what keeps the two in step
     * whichever code path wrote the service.
     *
     * On the price: the form has one price field, so there is no second value
     * to keep in step and nothing to fall out of date. The first figure is the
     * amount the customer is told the service starts at — "100+" starts at 100
     * — so this is the price being quoted, not a guess at one. A price with no
     * digits in it leaves `base_price` null, and the booking form then refuses
     * the service rather than charging zero.
