/**
 * Where a login should send the browser afterwards — kept per guard.
 *
 * Laravel remembers where a guest was trying to go, so a login can put them back
 * there. It stores it in one session key, `url.intended`, written by whichever
 * guard's `auth` middleware happened to bounce the request:
 *
 *   - a signed-out customer asking for `/appointments` puts `url.intended` =
 *     `/appointments`; then
 *   - `redirect()->intended(route('admin.dashboard'))` in the admin login reads
 *     that same key and sends the staff member to the *customer* appointments page.
 *
 * The customer and admin guards share one session cookie (see config/auth.php),
 * so one session holds one `url.intended` and the two logins keep stealing each
 * other's. The symptom is an admin who signs in correctly and lands on
 * `/appointments`, which then bounces to `/login` because the customer guard is
 * not signed in — so the login appears to do nothing at all.
 *
 * The fix is to stop sharing the key. Each guard remembers its own destination
 * under a scoped key, and each login only ever reads its own:
 *
 *   - App\Http\Middleware\RememberIntendedUrl writes it, on the authenticated
 *     route groups, before `auth` has a chance to redirect; and
 *   - `pull()` below reads and clears it, falling back to the guard's own home.
 *
 * The framework's unscoped `url.intended` is left alone rather than fought over.
 * Nothing in this application reads it any more — both logins go through `pull()`
 * — and it is still written by `Authenticate` because that is what the framework
 * does; there is no per-guard seam to stop it at.
