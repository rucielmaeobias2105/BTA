/**
 * Whether this customer has been here before, and what they had done.
 *
 * Step 5 of the booking form branches on this — a first-timer is asked what they
 * had done elsewhere, a returning customer is shown their own record instead —
 * and `StoreBookingRequest` branches on the same thing to decide whether that
 * answer is required.
 *
 * Those two must never disagree. A form that shows the read-only history while
 * the server still demands the manual field fails every submission from a
 * returning customer, and the reverse fails every first-timer's; both are the
 * kind of bug that only shows up once there is real traffic. So the rule lives
 * here once and both callers read it.
 *
 * The rule is a *completed* appointment, not merely an existing one. A pending
 * booking says the customer intends to come; a cancelled one says they decided
 * not to. Neither is something that was done to their hair and nails, and
 * neither tells a stylist anything useful. A guest has no account and therefore
 * no history, so a guest is always a first-timer — which is why this returns
 * false rather than null for them.
