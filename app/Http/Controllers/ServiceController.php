     * Pagination is gone, deliberately. It paginated the flat service list, so
     * a category could straddle a page boundary — the second half of a category
     * with no heading above it, and half the "See More" button's meaning
     * depending on which page you were on. Categories are the unit now, and a
     * category that is not split across pages is what lets the layout put a
     * heading, a description and a single image beside the whole list.
     *
     * The whole active catalogue is a few dozen rows, so this costs nothing to
     * hold in memory, and the "See More" disclosure keeps a category with
     * twenty services from dominating the page.
