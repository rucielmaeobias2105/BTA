     * Admin Flow 3 — Appointment Management (list + filters).

     * The working list: un-archived rows only. Archived bookings are not missing
     * data, they are filed elsewhere — `archived()` — so an admin who wants them
     * follows one link rather than filtering a growing list by a flag.
     *
     * Opening this page is also what marks the bookings on it as seen.
     *
     * The sidebar badge and the tab title's "(n)" are built from unseen bookings
     * rather than Pending ones, and this is where "unseen" stops being true. It
     * happens here, in the action, and first — before any query below runs and
     * long before the layout renders — so the very first response already has no
     * badge and no title prefix on it. Nothing about that depends on JavaScript,
     * a later fetch, or the order two pieces of markup happen to render in: by
     * the time the sidebar partial asks how many bookings are unseen, the answer
     * is genuinely zero.
     *
     * Server-side because the alternative is a badge that forgets. The admin
     * reloads, or navigates to Reports and comes back, and a count that lived in
     * a `sessionStorage` key or a one-shot DOM tweak would be back on the page.
