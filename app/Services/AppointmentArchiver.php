/**
 * Moving finished bookings out of the working list.
 *
 * Two ways in, one decision:
 *
 *   - `archive()`, called by the admin's row action, which takes effect at once
 *     and records who asked for it; and
 *   - `sweep()`, called by the nightly scheduled command, which archives anything
 *     Completed more than 30 days ago and nobody has touched since.
 *
 * The 30-day rule applies to *Completed only*, not to Cancelled. A cancelled
 * booking is already inert — it holds no slot, no stock reservation and nothing
 * anybody has to do — so leaving it in the list costs the salon nothing, whereas a
 * completed one is real history that quietly grows the queue. Cancelled rows are
 * still archivable by hand, and still deletable; they are simply not swept.
