        {{-- Title only. The eyebrow and the standfirst described the page rather
             than titling it, and the card's identity block already says who this
             account belongs to. --}}
        <x-ui.page-header title="Profile Management" />

        {{-- Above the card, not inside it: the summary reads as a page-level
             report on the submission, the same place the old three-card layout
             put it. --}}

        {{--
            One card, identity block on top and every field inside it.

            The reference this follows is a single surface rather than a stack of
            them: a centred avatar with the account's name and email under it,
            then the fields in a two-column grid, then one full-width save. The
            card carries the salon's own recipe — gold hairline, cream ground,
            soft card shadow — with the reference's 20px radius and a roomier
            body padding than the default card.

            The <form> wraps the card rather than sitting inside it. Visually
            that is the same card; it also keeps the photo input and the
            remove-picture control inside the form, where they have to be to
            submit, without the identity block having to be threaded through a
            nested form.

            `profilePhotoCrop` wraps the form so the crop dialog can live beside
            it. The dialog is `position: fixed`, so where it sits in the document
            does not affect where it appears — what matters is that it is inside
            the scope, because it reads `open`, `close()` and `busy` from it.

            Field names, method and the photo controls are unchanged, so the
            upload is still a plain `profile_photo` POST. The only difference is
            that the file in it is now the cropped one.

                            It used to be a permanent hidden `remove_photo=1`
                            input plus a button whose handler set `.checked = true`
                            on it — a no-op, because a hidden input has no checked
                            state. The flag therefore went out with *every* save,
                            and `ProfileController::update()` deletes the photo
                            whenever it sees it and no new file was chosen, so
                            editing a name quietly unlinked your picture.

                            exactly the semantics wanted, and it needs no

    Cropper.js, vendored rather than bundled.

    Same library and version as the reference implementation this was ported
    from (Cropper.js v1.6.2), loaded from `public/vendor/` rather than npm so the
    version is pinned by a file in the repository instead of a range in
    package.json — a cropper that changes its defaults between versions would
    change the output size without anything here saying so.

    Pushed onto `head`/`scripts` rather than added to the layout: this is the only
    screen that needs it, and 37 KB on every page to serve one dialog is not worth
    it. `x-on:click` on this page's Alpine directives is deliberate — Blade
    compiles `@click` and leaves it as inert text.
