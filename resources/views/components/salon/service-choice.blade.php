     * beside it, which is plain markup in the parent view, compiles correctly and
     * goes on behaving perfectly. All the cards visible next to a working-looking
     * button is what that mismatch looks like.

     * So the key is passed as data and this view writes the binding itself, which
     * is ordinary Blade and compiles as expected.

     * compiler can pick one out of a comment and swallow the rest of the file.

{{--
    One bookable service in step 1 of the booking form: a tick box, the name, what
    it costs, and whether it can be booked at all.

    Lives here rather than inline in `customer/appointments/create.blade.php`
    for the same reason `x-salon.service-row` does. This view renders every
    service twice — the four a category shows, and the rest behind its See More —
    and the two copies are identical apart from the Alpine directives that hide
    the overflow. Written out twice, the copies would drift, and the drift would
    show up as one row behaving differently from its neighbours.

* `x-show="isCategoryExpanded('<key>')"` in `$reveal` below, rather than
     * being accepted as an attribute from the caller — see the prop's note.
     * Everything else is passed through `{{ $attributes }}` on the `<label>`,
     * so the classes here are the only classes on the element.

    Alpine state it reads, all from the enclosing `bookingForm` scope:
    `selectedIds`, `isSelected(id)`, `toggle(id, checked)`.
