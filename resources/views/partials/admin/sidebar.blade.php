     * every row and closed the tab saw the count unchanged, because reading is not
     * deciding — so it sat there all day telling them something they already knew.

     * the badge, and a booking that arrives afterwards brings it back. Pending
     * still means Pending; it just no longer doubles as "unread".

{{--
    Visibility is deliberately NOT driven by `x-show`. Alpine writes an inline
    `display: none` when the expression is false, and an inline style outranks
    every `lg:` utility, so a `x-show="sidebar"` on a `sidebar: false` wrapper
    hid the panel at desktop width too — with the only trigger (the topbar
    hamburger) itself `lg:hidden`, so it could never be reopened.

    Instead the drawer state is a translate: `-translate-x-full` parks it
    off-canvas below `lg`, and `lg:!translate-x-0` (important, so it beats the
    bound class) pins it in flow from `lg` up. The bound open state is
    `!translate-x-0` for the same reason, which keeps "closed" and "open"
    mutually exclusive instead of relying on Tailwind's rule order.

    From `lg` the panel is `sticky` at the top and exactly one viewport tall, so
    the nav's own `overflow-y-auto` engages and only the links scroll — the brand
    header and the profile/logout footer stay pinned. A static, auto-height
    sidebar grows with the nav instead, which pushes the whole page down.
