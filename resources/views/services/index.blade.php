                One card per category, two to a row.

                Each card is split into two columns: the category's name and its
                price list on the left, one photo of that category on the right.
                That is the arrangement the salon price list itself uses, and it
                is the one a customer comparing two categories can scan — a photo
                beside the list it belongs to, rather than a banner above a stack
                of text they have to read past to find out what they are looking
                at.

                The image is the category's own, not a service's. A customer
                scanning this page is asking "what do you do here?", and eleven
                near-identical photos of individual treatments would answer a
                question they are not asking. Where a category has no photo of
                its own, `ServiceCategory::imagePath()` falls through a service's
                uploaded photo and the configured file to a neutral default, so
                there is always an image and never a broken one.

                Cards are equal height within a row, so the price lists of two
                categories line up instead of leaving a ragged edge.

                A category shows at most four services. Past that a "See All"
                button reveals the rest in place, rather than linking somewhere
                else: the whole point of the layout is that a category and its
                prices read together, and a link out would split the two.

                        The Alpine scope rides on the card only when there is

                        `x-data`, so it has no disclosure state to be stale about
                        and nothing to wire up.

                                 category. `order-first` above `sm` puts it back on
                                 top, where a full-width photo has room to be a photo
                                 and the card still says what it is at a glance.

                                 `self-center` IS THE FIX, and the reason is worth
                                 recording so nobody tidies it away.

                                 The card is a flex row from `sm` up, and a flex item
                                 is `align-self: stretch` by default — which means
                                 its height is set to the height of the tallest item
                                 beside it. That silently overrode the aspect ratio:
                                 the browser reported `aspect-ratio` and then ignored
                                 it, because a definite cross-size from the flex line
                                 wins over a ratio.

                                 So the photo was not 5:7 at all. It was "as tall as
                                 the price list happens to be" — measured on the same
                                 card at 292px collapsed and 562px expanded, and
                                 292px against 206px between the two cards. Nothing
                                 was distorted; `object-cover` was doing its job. But
                                 the picture changed size every time the list did,
                                 which is what makes it read as broken.

                                 Centring instead of stretching takes the height back
                                 from the ratio: now only the width decides it, so
                                 expanding the list makes the card taller and the
                                 photo sits in the middle of it, unchanged, over the
                                 card's own background.

                                 `w-full` is kept alongside `self-center`
                                 deliberately. Below `sm` this is a flex *column*,
                                 where `align-self` acts on the horizontal axis —
                                 without `w-full` the photo would shrink to its
                                 content width instead of filling the phone.

                                 16:9 below `sm`, because a full-width photo on a
                                 phone at 5:7 is a wall of image; 5:7 from `sm` up,
                                 which is the portrait crop the price list wants. Both
                                 cards take their width from the same steps, so the
                                 two photos are the same size on any given screen.
