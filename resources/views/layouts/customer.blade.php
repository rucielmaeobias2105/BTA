         Read by `sessionSync`, which writes it to `localStorage` and watches for
         another tab writing a different one — the mechanism that stops Tab A
         from sitting on a customer dashboard after Tab B has signed in as an
         admin. The server half is `App\Support\SessionIdentity`. --}}
    <meta name="bta-session" content="{{ \App\Support\SessionIdentity::key() }}">

    {{-- Where `sessionSync` sends a tab when the browser's identity changes to
         something this page is not. Read from the document rather than hardcoded
         in the script, so the routing lives in routes/web.php and the two
         layouts can each contribute their own home. A tab that finds none stays
         put rather than looping. --}}

    <meta name="bta-login-web" content="{{ route('login') }}">

    {{-- Where the liveness probe lives. Published rather than hardcoded in
         `sessionSync`, because this application is served out of a subdirectory
         (`htdocs/BTA/public`) and a root-absolute `/session-status` 404s there,
         which silently disables the back/forward-cache check. --}}

    {{-- Tab title: "HOME | Balai ti Arjud". The section is upper-cased here so
         every view keeps writing natural-cased titles.

         Signed in, it carries the unread count in front, the way Messenger does:
         "(3) HOME | Balai ti Arjud". Rendered server-side as well as updated by
         the poller, because the moment a user reads the title to decide whether
         to switch to a background tab is before the bundle has finished
         loading. A guest gets the plain title — `customerUnread()` is zero when
         nobody is signed in, so the prefix is simply absent.

         The count is the same number the navbar bell badges (see
         `App\Support\TabTitle`), and `notificationBell` keeps both in step from
         one poll. --}}
