         another tab writing a different one — the mechanism that stops a customer
         tab from sitting on a stale session after the staff portal has been
         signed into. The server half is `App\Support\SessionIdentity`. --}}

    {{-- Where the liveness probe lives. Published rather than hardcoded in

         (`htdocs/BTA/public`) and a root-absolute `/session-status` 404s there,

    {{-- "(2) APPOINTMENTS | Balai ti Arjud Admin" while something has arrived the
         salon has not looked at, the plain title when there is nothing. Server-
         rendered rather than left entirely to JavaScript so the count is right
         before the bundle loads, and kept live afterwards by
         `adminLiveNotifications` from the same poll that drives the two sidebar
         badges — see App\Support\TabTitle.

         Both this and the Appointments badge ask
         `Appointment::unseenForAdminCount()`, so they cannot report different
         numbers for the same rows. The count is computed while the layout
         renders, which is after the index action has marked what it showed as
         seen — so landing on the Appointments page produces a title with no
         prefix at all, with nothing to correct on the client. --}}

        The live work queue, with no widget of its own.

        This used to be the topbar's notification bell, badge and all, which meant
        the number sat in the bar while the rows that acted on it sat in the
        sidebar. The count is now on those rows, and all that was left of the bell
        was the polling — so that is what lives here: one component, mounted once
        per page, that keeps the two sidebar badges and the tab title's "(n)" in
        step from a single request.

        It renders nothing, so where it is mounted does not matter visually. It
        listens on the window for `admin-read-all` and `admin-read-message` so the
        Messages screen can ask it to mark things read without a second poller and
        without the screen having to know anything about the feed.
