        Settled bookings that have left the working list.

        Reached from the pill on the Appointments list, and deliberately a separate
        screen rather than a filter there: an archived booking is out of the queue
        whatever you search for, so offering it as one of that list's status tabs
        would suggest it is still in it.

        Two ways a row gets here, and the "Archived by" column is what tells them
        apart — a person (the Archive action on the list) or "Automatic" (the
        nightly sweep that archives completed bookings past the retention window).
        Both refuse a live booking, so nothing on this screen is in progress.

        Read-mostly, as its own comment says: Restore is the action that changes
        anything here, and Delete is carried over from the working list so an
        archived record can still be removed outright when the admin means it.

        The search box and the way back sit alone on this row.

        There used to be a sentence here explaining that these are bookings which
        have been archived and are out of the working list but still on record. It
        said nothing the page does not already say: the heading says "Archived
        Appointments", every row is visibly archived, and the Search placeholder
        says what can be searched. What it really did was take a full line of the
        most valuable space on the screen to state what the user had already
        chosen to look at by clicking the Archived link.

            `appointmentBulk` is the same selection component the customer's
            appointments list and the notifications list use, reading the same
            `ids[]` checkboxes. It is deliberately not a fourth implementation of
            "tick some rows": the select-all semantics — scoped to what is on this
            page, because the list is paginated — are the fiddly part, and having
            them written once is what stops this screen disagreeing with the other
            two about what "select all" means.

            The checkboxes are outside any form. The confirmation below renders
            its own hidden `ids[]` inputs from `selected`, so the same pattern
            serves the per-row actions and the bulk one.
