    {{--
        The "we sent you a link" page.

        Its own screen rather than a redirect back to the form, so the person who
        asked for a reset is told what to do next instead of being dropped on an
        empty form with a "sent" toast. It is deliberately not conditional on the
        address existing: the controller returns the same page either way, so this
        screen cannot be used to find out which addresses are registered.
