{{--
    Category create/edit fields: a name, an optional photo and an Active switch.

    The colour picker is gone, and so is every mention of the palette. What stays
    behind the scenes is what matters here: `service_categories.color` is still
    written and still read, because the admin calendar legend and its chips
    cannot work without it. A new category is handed the next unused salon
    palette colour by `ServiceCategoryController::store()`, and an existing one
    keeps whatever it already has — the admin just no longer picks one by hand.

    The photo is the picture the Services page shows beside this category's price
    list, so the field says plainly what it is for: an admin choosing a picture
    for a price list is not the same act as choosing a picture for a service.
    Written inline rather than extracted to a component, as the technician form's
    equivalent is — two fields that say almost the same thing are not yet a
    pattern, and the technician one is a circle while this one is a panel.

    `enctype` is what makes the file input reach the server at all; without it
    the browser posts the filename as `photo` and validation cannot tell.
