/**
 * Keeps every tab in this browser agreeing about who is signed in.
 *
 * The problem: a session lives in a cookie, and every tab sends it. Sign in as a
 * CUSTOMER in Tab A, then open Tab B and sign in as ADMIN — Tab A is still
 * rendering a customer dashboard, with working links, until it happens to
 * navigate. Nothing in the page is wrong; the page is just out of date.
 *
 * The fix is two halves, and this is the client half. The server half is in the
 * two session controllers, which log the other guard out on login so only one
 * role is ever active. This half tells the *other tabs* about it:
 *
 *   - every rendered page states its own identity in a `bta-session` meta tag
 *     (`App\Support\SessionIdentity` writes it);
 *   - this page writes that identity to `localStorage`; and
 *   - the `storage` event fires in every *other* tab when one of them writes, so
 *     a tab whose rendered identity no longer matches what it hears knows the
 *     browser has moved on.
 *
 * `localStorage` rather than a cookie because `storage` events are the point:
 * a cookie is invisible to JavaScript in other tabs, which is the whole problem
 * being solved.
 *
 * Deliberately a label, never a token. What is stored is `admin:3` or `web:12`
 * or `guest` — enough to notice a change, useless to anyone forging a session.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one rule this module is built around
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `localStorage` is a noticeboard, not an oracle. The `bta-session` meta tag is
 * the only authority on *this* page, because the server rendered it from the
 * session cookie as it stands right now. So on load this module always writes
 * its own identity and never navigates.
 *
 * An earlier version had it the other way round: on load it read the stored
 * value, and if that disagreed with the page it treated the *stored* value as
 * the newer truth, navigated to it, and returned before writing anything back.
 * That is a loop with no exit:
 *
 *   - a tab that has just logged out renders `guest`, finds `web:13` stored, and
 *     is dragged straight back to `/appointments` — so logging out does not appear
 *     to work, and the page flickers;
 *   - `/appointments` then redirects to `/login`, which renders `guest`, finds
 *     `web:13` stored again, and is dragged back to `/appointments`;
 *   - and because the early return also skipped attaching the `storage`
 *     listener, nothing ever repaired the stale value or heard about a real
 *     change afterwards.
 *
 * Announcing unconditionally ends it: every page load writes the current truth,
 * so a page always agrees with the noticeboard by the time anything reads it.
 *
 * Navigation is then driven only by *another tab* — the `storage` event, or a
 * catch-up comparison when this tab is looked at again — and is budgeted to one
 * hop per identity, so no pair of pages can bounce a tab between them.

     * Tick-to-delete on the My Appointments list.
     *
     * Deliberately the same component as `notificationBulk` rather than a second
     * implementation of it. The two lists are the same interaction — tick a
     * settled row, tick a page of them, clear the set from one dialog — and
     * there is no behavioural difference between them: the appointments list
     * simply renders boxes only on rows the delete routes will accept, which is
     * a view decision and nothing the component has to know about.
     *
     * Counting only. The confirmation belongs to `x-ui.confirm-dialog`, which
     * reads `selected` when a trigger dispatches to it and carries the one real
     * form. The checkboxes keep `name="ids[]"` but no form owns them; the
     * dialog renders its own hidden `ids[]` inputs from `selected` on Yes.
     *
     * Select-all is scoped to what is on screen — the header toggle reads the
     * rendered boxes rather than a server-side total, and the label says "on
     * this page", because the list is paginated and only the boxes that were
     * drawn are ticked.
     *
     * Markup contract:
     *   <div x-data="appointmentBulk()">
     *       <input type="checkbox" name="ids[]" value="…" x-model="selected" />
     *
     * THIS ALIAS WAS BROKEN, AND SILENTLY SO
     *
     * It used to read `Alpine.data('appointmentBulk', () => notificationBulk())`.
     * `notificationBulk` is not a variable: `Alpine.data('notificationBulk', …)`
     * registers a *name*, and does not bind one. So the arrow function threw
     * `ReferenceError: notificationBulk is not defined` the moment either screen
     * mounted it, and the scope it produced was empty.
     *
     * Nothing on the page said so, because an empty scope is not a broken
     * element. The header checkbox still toggled itself — it is a real `<input>`
     * and the browser ticks it regardless of whether anything is listening — so
     * the customer saw a select-all box that filled in precisely nothing. The only
     * symptom was in the console, which is exactly the kind of bug that gets
     * reported as "the button does nothing" and then debugged in the wrong place.
     *
     * It affects both screens that used this name: the admin's Archived
     * Appointments list and the customer's My Appointments list. The notifications
     * list was fine, because it asks for `notificationBulk()` by name and that
     * registration always worked.
     *
     * `bulkSelection` is the factory both names now call, so the two cannot be
     * separate objects and this cannot drift again.

     * a separate app and start again.
     *
     * Cropper.js (v1.6.2, vendored at `public/vendor/cropper/`) is loaded by the

     * uncropped rather than the picker breaking.

     * is an ordinary link to the notifications page, and reading happens there.
     * Two reasons it did not survive:
     *
     *   - the read receipt was invisible. Nothing on screen said that opening the
     *     bell had marked eight things read, so a customer who opened it to
     *     check something had also silently cleared their badge.
     *   - the badge was the only place the count lived. Marking something read
     *     anywhere else could not move it, because the badge was twenty lines
     *     away in the header and had no idea.
     *
     * What is left is the part that was genuinely live: the count, kept current
     * by polling, and shared through `window.btaUnread` so the badge, the mobile
     * nav row and the tab title cannot disagree.
     *
     * Polling, not pushing. There is no WebSocket server in this project — no
     * Reverb, no Pusher — and standing one up to animate a badge would be a
     * second always-on process for a page that is otherwise plain PHP. A `fetch`

     * to a static badge rather than to a broken socket.

         *      away it would be invisible anyway: the page would change before
         *      the response arrived.
         *   2. fire the write behind the navigation. `keepalive` is what lets it
         *      finish — the browser does not cancel an in-flight keepalive request
         *      just because the document it was made from is going away, which is
         *      the difference between clearing the badge in the database and
         *      merely hiding it.
         *
         * A failure rolls the count back, because a badge reading zero over rows
         * that are still unread is the one state nobody can account for. It
         * usually cannot be seen at all — the navigation has replaced the page by
         * then, and the page renders from the database — but the next poll on a
         * tab that stayed put would be the thing that has to be true.

     * a corner badge and a dropdown. The bell and the dropdown are gone, and the
     * count they showed is on the sidebar instead, beside the rows that act on
     * it. What is left is the part that had nothing to do with the icon — the
     * single poll that keeps those badges and the tab title in step.
     *
     * So it renders nothing and lives in the layout. Mounted once per page rather
     * than in the sidebar because the sidebar is the thing being updated: a
     * component inside the element it broadcasts to would be a component whose
     * lifetime is tied to markup it is only supposed to be observing.
     *
     * Three consumers, one request, which is the whole point. `btaAdminUnread`
     * drives the tab title, and `admin-pending` / `admin-messages` each carry one
     * half to the sidebar row that displays it — so a count can never appear on
     * two rows with different numbers, and the title can never disagree with the
     * badges beside it.
     *
     * Also the single place the work queue is *changed*. It listens on the window
     * for `admin-read-all` and `admin-read-message` so the Messages screen can
     * mark an enquiry read without a second poller and without knowing anything
     * about the feed.
     *
     * The badged Messages row in the sidebar dispatches `admin-read-all` too, for
     * the same reason it exists at all rather than only the screen's button: a
     * badge that outlives the click that dismissed it is the behaviour the
     * removed topbar bell was criticised for. The `keepalive` on the write is what
     * makes that safe — a click on a link cannot be relied on to finish a request
     * the navigation interrupts.
