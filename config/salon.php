    | The trading name, the address, the phone number and the Facebook page.
    |
    | These were written into four different views — the About page's Find Us
    | card, the contact page's detail cards, and the footer's Visit Us column —
    | and had already drifted: the footer's `tel:` link pointed at +63 900 000
    | 000 while every visible string said +63 965 6244 405, and the About page
    | punctuated the street name differently from the footer. A visitor who
    | tapped the footer's number dialled nobody.
    |
    | One place to change them now. `phone_display` is what a human reads and
    | `phone_e164` is what `tel:` needs; both are here so they cannot disagree,
    | and `x-saloon.contact` renders the pair together.
    |
    | Override any of these from .env without touching markup.

    | It is here now so the wording is config rather than another string living
    | in a view — the same reason the contact facts above are.

    | What the About page's Facebook row reads, as distinct from where it points.

    | It used to print the profile URL as its own visible text, so the page

    | dropped, which is the sort of thing that survives a rename because it is
    | nobody's job to read it back. The About card and the footer both print

    | The embed used on the public About page's "Find Us" section.
    |
    | This is a Street View panorama rather than a top-down map, so it opens
    | facing the shopfront. The pin and the address text are deliberately not
    | used as the map query: a text address resolves to whichever building
    | Google guesses, which is how this ended up pointing at a gas station
    | further down Abra - Kalinga Rd.
    |
    | The `pb` parameter carries everything the viewer needs:
    |   apTNKjgpSFkhDHaIb1O_Nw  panorama ID
    |   17.613647 / 120.6525178 location
    |   149.92                  heading, in degrees, facing the shop

    | Override with MAP_EMBED_URL in .env if the address ever changes, so the
    | value does not have to be edited into markup.

    | pin for the same coordinates:

    | Category images
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The Services page is laid out one section per category: the name and its
    | services on the left, ONE representative image on the right. A category
    | has no image column of its own, so the representative shot is configured
    | here, keyed by the category name the salon actually uses in the catalogue.
    |
    | Lookup is forgiving, not exact. The same normalisation the calendar's
    | palette uses is applied to the configured keys and the category name, so
    | "Spa Services" in the config still matches a category stored as "Spa", and
    | "Brow & Lash Extension" matches "Brow & Lash". An entry for a category that
    | no longer exists is simply never read.
    |
    | These are the salon's own photographs of the shop rather than
    | treatment-specific shots — it has not yet photographed each treatment
    | separately. Replacing a value here is the whole job of putting a real
    | photo against a category; the layout does not change. Drop a file into
    | `public/images/` and point the key at it, e.g. 'images/brow-lash.jpg'.
    |
    | A service that has uploaded its own photo wins over all of this: if any
    | service in the category has a `photo_path`, that photo is the
    | representative one. So uploading photos service by service gradually
    | replaces these fallbacks without anyone editing this file.
